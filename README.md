# Solar Savings Repo

This repo contains two code files:
- _app.py_ builds the streamlit dashboard
- _app_services.py_ contains the class `SolarPanels` which does all the calculations in the background

To launch the dashboard locally, run the following command from the _solar-savings_ folder:
`streamlit run app.py`

There are plenty of improvements to be made! Those related to new features are outlined in the sidebar of the dasboard. Others are marked in the code with a comment flagged by `@TODO`.
